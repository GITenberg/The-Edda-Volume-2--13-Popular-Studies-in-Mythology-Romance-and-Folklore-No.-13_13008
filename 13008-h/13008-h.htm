</p><span class="pageno"><a id="d0e102"></a>Page 3</span><a id="d0e105"></a><h1>The Heroic Mythology of the North</h1>
<p id="d0e108">Sigemund the Waelsing and Fitela, Aetla, Eormanric the Goth and Gifica of Burgundy, Ongendtheow and Theodric, Heorrenda and
the Heodenings, and Weland the Smith: all these heroes of Germanic legend were known to the writers of our earliest English
literature. But in most cases the only evidence of this knowledge is a word, a name, here and there, with no hint of the story
attached. For circumstances directed the poetical gifts of the Saxons in England towards legends of the saints and Biblical
paraphrase, away from the native heroes of the race; while later events completed the exclusion of Germanic legend from our
literature, by substituting French and Celtic romance. Nevertheless, these few brief references in <i>Beowulf</i> and in the small group of heathen English relics give us the right to a peculiar interest in the hero-poems of the Edda.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e113"></a>Page 4</span>In studying these heroic poems, therefore, we are confronted by problems entirely different in character from those which
have to be considered in connexion with the mythical texts. Those are in the main the product of one, the Northern, branch
of the Germanic race, as we have seen (No. 12 of this series), and the chief question to be determined is whether they represent,
however altered in form, a mythology common to all the Germans, and as such necessarily early; or whether they are in substance,
as well as in form, a specific creation of the Scandinavians, and therefore late and secondary. The heroic poems of the Edda,
on the contrary, with the exception of the Helgi cycle, have very close analogues in the literatures of the other great branches
of the Germanic race, and these we are able to compare with the Northern versions.

</p>
<p id="d0e115">The Edda contains poems belonging to the following heroic cycles:

</p>
<p id="d0e117">(<i>a</i>) <b>Weland the Smith</b>.&#8212;Anglo-Saxon literature has several references to this cycle, which must have been a very popular one; and there is also
a late Continental German version preserved in an Icelandic translation. But the poem in the Edda is the oldest connected
form of the story.

</p>
<p id="d0e125">(<i>b</i>) <b>Sigurd and the Nibelungs</b>.&#8212;Again the oldest reference is in Anglo-Saxon.  There <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e133"></a>Page 5</span>are two well-known Continental German versions in the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i> and the late Icelandic <i>Thidreks Saga</i>, but the Edda, on the whole, has preserved an earlier form of the legend. With it is loosely connected

</p>
<p id="d0e141">(<i>c</i>) <b>The Ermanric Cycle</b>.&#8212;The oldest references to this are in Latin and Anglo-Saxon. The Continental German version in the <i>Thidreks Saga</i> is late, and, like that in the Edda, contaminated with the Sigurd story, with which it had originally nothing to do.

</p>
<p id="d0e152">(<i>d</i>) <b>Helgi</b>.&#8212;This cycle, at least in its present form, is peculiar to the Scandinavian North.

</p>
<p id="d0e160">All the above-named poems are contained in Codex Regius of the Elder Edda. From other sources we may add other poems which
are Eddic, not Skaldic, in style, in which other heroic cycles are represented. The great majority of the poems deal with
the favourite story of the Volsungs, which threatens to swamp all the rest; for one hero after another, Burgundian, Hun, Goth,
was absorbed into it. The poems in this part of the MS. differ far more widely in date and style than do the mythological
ones; many of the Volsung-lays are comparatively late, and lack the fine simplicity which characterises the older popular
poetry.

</p>
<p id="d0e162"><b>V&ouml;lund</b>.&#8212;The lay of V&ouml;lund, the wonderful smith, the Weland of the Old English poems and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e166"></a>Page 6</span>the only Germanic hero who survived for any considerable time in English popular tradition, stands alone in its cycle, and
is the first heroic poem in the MS. It is in a very fragmentary state, some of the deficiencies being supplied by short pieces
of prose. There are two motives in the story: the Swan-maids, and the Vengeance of the Captive Smith. Three brothers, Slagfinn,
Egil and V&ouml;lund, sons of the Finnish King, while out hunting built themselves a house by the lake in Wolfsdale. There, early
one morning, they saw three Valkyries spinning, their swancoats lying beside them. The brothers took them home; but after
seven years the swan-maidens, wearied of their life, flew away to battle, and did not return.

</p>
<p id="d0e168">&#8220;Seven years they stayed there, but in the eighth longing seized them, and in the ninth need parted them.&#8221; Egil and Slagfinn
went to seek their wives, but V&ouml;lund stayed where he was and worked at his forge. There Nithud, King of Sweden, took him captive:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e171">&#8220;Men went by night in studded mailcoats; their shields shone by the waning moon. They dismounted from the saddle at the hall-gable,
and went in along the hall. They saw rings strung on bast which the hero owned, seven hundred in all; they took them off and
put, them on again, all but one. The keen-eyed archer V&ouml;lund came in from hunting, from a far road.... He sat on a bear-skin
and counted his rings, and the prince of the elves missed one; he thought Hlodve's <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e173"></a>Page 7</span>daughter, the fairy-maid, had come back. He sat so long that he fell asleep, and awoke powerless: heavy bonds were on his
hands, and fetters clasped on his feet.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e176">They took him away and imprisoned him, ham-strung, on an island to forge treasures for his captors. Then V&ouml;lund planned vengeance:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e179">&#8221;'I see on Nithud's girdle the sword which I knew keenest and best, and which I forged with all my skill. The glittering blade
is taken from me for ever; I shall not see it borne to V&ouml;lund's smithy. Now B&ouml;dvild wears my bride's red ring; I expect no
atonement.' He sat and slept not, but struck with his hammer.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e182">Nithud's children came to see him in his smithy: the two boys he slew, and made drinking-cups for Nithud from their skulls;
and the daughter B&ouml;dvild he beguiled, and having made himself wings he rose into the air and left her weeping for her lover
and Nithud mourning his sons.

</p>
<p id="d0e184">In the Old English poems allusion is made only to the second part of the story; there is no reference to the legend of the
enchanted brides, which is indeed distinct in origin, being identical with the common tale of the fairy wife who is obliged
to return to animal shape through some breach of agreement by her mortal husband. This incident of the compact (<i>i.e.</i>, to hide the swan-coat, to refrain from asking the wife's name, or whatever it may have been) has been lost in the V&ouml;lund
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e189"></a>Page 8</span>tale. The Continental version is told in the late Icelandic <i>Thidreks Saga</i>, where it is brought into connexion with the Volsung story; in this the story of the second brother, Egil the archer, is
also given, and its antiquity is supported by the pictures on the Anglo-Saxon carved whale-bone box known as the Franks Casket,
dated by Professor Napier at about 700 A.D. The adventures of the third brother, Slagfinn, have not survived. The Anglo-Saxon
gives V&ouml;lund and B&ouml;dvild a son, Widia or Wudga, the Wittich who appears as a follower of Dietrich's in the Continental German
sources.

</p>
<p id="d0e194"><b>The Volsungs</b>.&#8212;No story better illustrates the growth of heroic legend than the Volsung cycle. It is composite, four or five mythical motives
combining to form the nucleus; and as it took possession more and more strongly of the imagination of the early Germans, and
still more of the Scandinavians, other heroic cycles were brought into dependence on it. None of the Eddic poems on the subject
are quite equal in poetic value to the Helgi lays; many are fragmentary, several late, and only one attempts a review of the
whole story. The outline is as follows: Sigurd the Volsung, son of Sigmund and brother of Sinfj&ouml;tli, slays the dragon who
guards the Nibelungs' hoard on the Glittering Heath, and thus inherits the curse which <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e198"></a>Page 9</span>accompanies the treasure; he finds and wakens Brynhild the Valkyrie, lying in an enchanted sleep guarded by a ring of fire,
loves her and plights troth with her; Grimhild, wife of the Burgundian Giuki, by enchantment causes him to forget the Valkyrie,
to love her own daughter Gudrun, and, since he alone can cross the fire, to win Brynhild for her son Gunnar. After the marriage,
Brynhild discovers the trick, and incites her husband and his brothers to kill Sigurd.

</p>
<p id="d0e200">The series begins with a prose piece on the Death of Sinfj&ouml;tli, which says that after Sinfj&ouml;tli, son of Sigmund, Volsung's
son (which should be Valsi's son, Volsung being a tribal, not a personal, name), had been poisoned by his stepmother Borghild,
Sigmund married Hj&ouml;rdis, Eylimi's daughter, had a son Sigurd, and fell in battle against the race of Hunding. Sigmund, as
in all other Norse sources, is said to be king in Frankland, which, like the Niderlant of the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>, means the low lands on the Rhine. The scene of the story is always near that river: Sigurd was slain by the Rhine, and the
treasure of the Rhine is quoted as proverbial in the V&ouml;lund lay.

</p>
<p id="d0e205"><i>Gripisspa</i> (the Prophecy of Gripi), which follows, is appropriately placed first of the Volsung poems, since it gives a summary of the
whole story. Sigurd rides to see his mother's brother, Gripi, the wisest of men, to ask about his destiny, and the soothsayer
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e209"></a>Page 10</span>prophesies his adventures and early death. This poem makes clear some original features of the legend which are obscured elsewhere,
especially in the Gudrun set; Grimhild's treachery, and Sigurd's unintentional breach of faith to Brynhild. In the speeches
of both Gripi and Sigurd, the poet shows clearly that Brynhild had the first right to Sigurd's faith, while the seer repeatedly
protests his innocence in breaking it: &#8220;Thou shalt never be blamed though thou didst betray the royal maid.... No better man
shall come on earth beneath the sun than thou, Sigurd.&#8221; On the other hand, the poet gives no indication that Brynhild and
the sleeping Valkyrie are the same, which is a sign of confusion. Like all poems in this form, <i>Gripisspa</i> is a late composition embodying earlier tradition.

</p>
<p id="d0e214">The other poems are mostly episodical, though arranged so as to form a continued narrative. <i>Gripisspa</i> is followed by a compilation from two or more poems in different metres, generally divided into three parts in the editions:
<i>Reginsmal</i> gives the early history of the treasure and the dragon, and Sigurd's battle with Hunding's sons; <i>Fafnismal</i>, the slaying of the dragon and the advice of the talking birds; <i>Sigrdrifumal</i>, the awakening of the Valkyrie. Then follows a fragment on the death of Sigurd. All the rest, except the poem generally called
the <i>Third</i>, or <i>Short, Sigurd Lay</i> (which tells of the marriage with Gudrun and Sigurd's wooing <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e234"></a>Page 11</span>of Brynhild for Gunnar) continue the story after Sigurd's death, taking up the death of Brynhild, Gudrun's mourning, and the
fates of the other heroes who became connected with the legend of the treasure.

</p>
<p id="d0e236">In addition to the poems in the Elder Edda, an account of the story is given by Snorri in <i>Skaldskaparmal</i>, but it is founded almost entirely on the surviving lays. <i>V&ouml;lsunga Saga</i> is also a paraphrase, but more valuable, since parts of it are founded on lost poems, and it therefore, to some extent, represents
independent tradition. It was, unfortunately from a literary point of view, compiled after the great saga-time was over, in
the decadent fourteenth century, when material of all kinds, classical, biblical, romantic, mythological, was hastily cast
into saga-form. It is not, like the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>, a work of art, but it has what in this case is perhaps of greater importance, the one great virtue of fidelity. The compiler
did not, like the author of the German masterpiece, boldly recast his material in the spirit of his own time; he clung closely
to his originals, only trying with hesitating hand to copy the favourite literary form of the Icelander. As a saga, therefore,
<i>V&ouml;lsunga</i> is far behind not only such great works as <i>Njala</i>, but also many of the smaller sagas. It lacks form, and is marred by inconsistencies; it is often careless in grammar and
diction; it is full of traces of the decadent <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e253"></a>Page 12</span>romantic age. Sigurd, in the true spirit of romance, is endowed with magic weapons and supernatural powers, which are no improvement
on the heroic tradition, &#8220;Courage is better than a good sword.&#8221; At every turn, Odin is at hand to help him, which tends to
efface the older and truer picture of the hero with all the fates against him; such heroes, found again and again in the historic
sagas, more truly represent the heathen heroic age and that belief in the selfishness and caprice of the Gods on which the
whole idea of sacrifice rests. There is also the inevitable deterioration in the character of Brynhild, without the compensating
elevation in that of her rival by which the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i> places Chriemhild on a height as lofty and unapproachable as that occupied by the Norse Valkyrie; the Brynhild of <i>V&ouml;lsunga Saga</i> is something of a virago, the Gudrun is jealous and shrewish. But for actual material, the compiler is absolutely to be trusted;
and <i>V&ouml;lsunga Saga</i> is therefore, in spite of artistic faults, a priceless treasure-house for the real features of the legend.

</p>
<p id="d0e264">There are two main elements in the Volsung story: the slaying of the dragon, and the awakening and desertion of Brynhild.
The latter is brought into close connexion with the former, which becomes the real centre of the action. In the Anglo-Saxon
reference, the fragment in <i>Beowulf</i>, the second episode does not appear.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e269"></a>Page 13</span></p>
<p id="d0e270">In this, the oldest version of the story, which, except for a vague reference to early feats by Sigmund and Sinfj&ouml;tli, consists
solely of the dragon adventure, the hero is not Sigurd, but Sigemund the Waelsing. All that it tells is that Sigemund, Fitela
(Sinfj&ouml;tli) not being with him, killed the dragon, the guardian of the hoard, and loaded a ship with the treasure. The few
preceding lines only mention the war which Sigmund and Sinfj&ouml;tli waged on their foes. They are there uncle and nephew, and
there is no suggestion of the closer relationship assigned to them by <i>V&ouml;lsunga Saga</i>, which tells their story in full.

</p>
<p id="d0e275">Sigmund, one of the ten sons of Volsung (who is himself of miraculous birth) and the Wishmaiden Hlod, is one of the chosen
heroes of Odin. His twin-sister Signy is married against her will to Siggeir, an hereditary enemy, and at the wedding-feast
Odin enters and thrusts a sword up to the hilt into the tree growing in the middle of the hall. All try to draw it, but only
the chosen Sigmund succeeds. Siggeir, on returning to his own home with his unwilling bride, invites her father and brothers
to a feast. Though suspecting treachery, they come, and are killed one after another, except Sigmund who is secretly saved
by his sister and hidden in the wood. She meditates revenge, and as her two sons grow up to the age of ten, she tests their
courage, and finding it wanting makes <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e277"></a>Page 14</span>Sigmund kill both: the expected hero must be a Volsung through both parents. She therefore visits Sigmund in disguise, and
her third son, Sinfj&ouml;tli, is the child of the Volsung pair. At ten years old, she sends him to live in the wood with Sigmund,
who only knows him as Signy's son. For years they live as wer-wolves in the wood, till the time comes for vengeance. They
set fire to Siggeir's hall; and Signy, after revealing Sinfj&ouml;tli's real parentage, goes back into the fire and dies there,
her vengeance achieved:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e280">&#8220;I killed my children, because I thought them too weak to avenge our father; Sinfj&ouml;tli has a warrior's might because he is
both son's son and daughter's son to King Volsung. I have laboured to this end, that King Siggeir should meet his death; I
have so toiled for the achieving of revenge that I am now on no condition fit for life. As I lived by force with King Siggeir,
of free will shall I die with him.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e283">Though no poem survives on this subject, the story is certainly primitive; its savage character vouches for its antiquity.
<i>V&ouml;lsunga</i> then reproduces the substance of the prose <i>Death of Sinfj&ouml;tli</i> mentioned above, the object of which, as a part of the cycle, seems to be to remove Sinfj&ouml;tli and leave the field clear for
Sigurd. It preserves a touch which may be original in Sinfj&ouml;tli's burial, which resembles that of Scyld in <i>Beowulf</i>: his father lays him in a boat steered by an old man, which immediately disappears.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e294"></a>Page 15</span></p>
<p id="d0e295">Sigmund and Sinfj&ouml;tli are always close comrades, &#8220;need-companions&#8221; as the Anglo-Saxon calls them. They are indivisible and
form one story. Sigurd, on the other hand, is only born after his father Sigmund's death. <i>V&ouml;lsunga</i> says that Sigmund fell in battle against Hunding, through the interference of Odin, who, justifying Loki's taunt that he
&#8220;knew not how to give the victory fairly,&#8221; shattered with his spear the sword he had given to the Volsung. For this again
we have to depend entirely on the prose, except for one line in <i>Hyndluljod</i>: &#8220;The Father of Hosts gives gold to his followers;... he gave Sigmund a sword.&#8221; And from the poems too, Sigurd's fatherless
childhood is only to be inferred from an isolated reference, where giving himself a false name he says to Fafni: &#8220;I came a
motherless child; I have no father like the sons of men.&#8221; Sigmund, dying, left the fragments of the sword to be given to his
unborn son, and Sigurd's fosterfather Regin forged them anew for the future dragon-slayer. But Sigurd's first deed was to
avenge on Hunding's race the death of his father and his mother's father. <i>V&ouml;lsunga</i> tells this story first of Helgi and Sinfj&ouml;tli, then of Sigurd, to whom the poems also attribute the deed. It is followed
by the dragon-slaying.

</p>
<p id="d0e306">Up to this point, the story of Sigurd consists roughly of the same features which mark that of Sigmund and Sinfj&ouml;tli. Both
are probably, like <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e308"></a>Page 16</span>Helgi, versions of a race-hero myth. In each case there is the usual irregular birth, in different forms, both familiar; a
third type, the miraculous or supernatural birth, is attributed by <i>V&ouml;lsunga</i> to Sigmund's father Volsung. Each story again includes a deed of vengeance, and a dragon and treasure. The sword which the
hero alone could draw, and the wer-wolf, appear only in the Sigmund and Sinfj&ouml;tli version. Among those Germanic races which
brought the legend to full perfection, Sigurd's version soon became the sole one, and Sigmund and Sinfj&ouml;tli practically drop
out.

</p>
<p id="d0e313">The Dragon legend of the Edda is much fuller and more elaborate than that of any other mythology. As a rule tradition is satisfied
with the existence of the monster &#8220;old and proud of his treasure,&#8221; but here we are told its full previous history, certain
features of which (such as the shape-shifting) are signs of antiquity, whether it was originally connected with the Volsungs
or not.

</p>
<p id="d0e315">As usual, <i>V&ouml;lsunga</i> gives the fullest account, in the form of a story told by Regin to his foster-son Sigurd, to incite him to slay the dragon.
Regin was one of three brothers, the sons of Hreidmar; one of the three, Otr, while in the water in otter's shape, was seen
by three of the Aesir, Odin, Loki and Hoeni, and killed by Loki. Hreidmar demanded as wergild enough gold to fill the otter's
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e320"></a>Page 17</span>skin, and Loki obtained it by catching the dwarf Andvari, who lived in a waterfall in the form of a fish, and allowing him
to ransom his head by giving up his wealth. One ring the dwarf tried to keep back, but in vain; and thereupon he laid a curse
upon it: that the ring with the rest of the gold should be the death of whoever should get possession of it. In giving the
gold to Hreidmar, Odin also tried to keep back the ring, but had to give it up to cover the last hair. Then Fafni, one of
the two remaining sons, killed his father, first victim of the curse, for the sake of the gold. He carried it away and lay
guarding it in the shape of a snake. But Regin the smith did not give up his hopes of possessing the hoard: he adopted as
his foster-son Sigurd the Volsung, thus getting into his power the hero fated to slay the dragon.

</p>
<p id="d0e322">The curse thus becomes the centre of the action, and the link between the two parts of the story, since it directly accounts
for Sigurd's unconscious treachery and his separation from Brynhild, and absolves the hero from blame by making him a victim
of fate. It destroys in turn Hreidmar, the Dragon, his brother Regin, the dragon-slayer himself, Brynhild (to whom he gave
the ring), and the Giukings, who claimed inheritance after Sigurd's death. Later writers carried its effects still further.


</p>
<p id="d0e324">This narrative is also told in the pieces of prose <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e326"></a>Page 18</span>interspersed through <i>Reginsmal</i>. The verse consists only of scraps of dialogue. The first of these comprises question and answer between Loki and the dwarf
Andvari in the form of the old riddle-poems, and seems to result from the confusion of two ideas: the question-and-answer
wager, and the captive's ransom by treasure. Then follows the curse, in less general terms than in the prose: &#8220;My gold shall
be the death of two brothers, and cause strife among eight kings; no one shall rejoice in the possession of my treasure.&#8221;
Next comes a short dialogue between Loki and Hreidmar, in which the former warns his host of the risk he runs in taking the
hoard. In the next fragment Hreidmar calls on his daughters to avenge him; Lyngheid replies that they cannot do so on their
own brother, and her father bids her bear a daughter whose son may avenge him. This has given rise to a suggestion that Hj&ouml;rdis,
Sigurd's mother, was daughter to Lyngheid, but if that is intended, it may only be due to the Norse passion for genealogy.
The next fragment brings Regin and Sigurd together, and the smith takes the young Volsung for his foster-son. A speech of
Sigurd's follows, in which he refuses to seek the treasure till he has avenged his father on Hunding's sons. The rest of the
poem is concerned with the battle with Hunding's race, and Sigurd's meeting with Odin by the way.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e331"></a>Page 19</span></p>
<p id="d0e332">The fight with Fafni is not described in verse, very little of this poetry being in narrative form; but <i>Fafnismal</i> gives a dialogue between the wounded dragon and his slayer. Fafni warns the Volsung against the hoard: &#8220;The ringing gold
and the glowing treasure, the rings shall be thy death.&#8221; Sigurd disregards the warning with the maxim &#8220;Every man must die
some time,&#8221; and asks questions of the dragon in the manner of <i>Vafthrudnismal</i>. Fafni, after repeating his warning, speaks of his brother's intended treachery: &#8220;Regin betrayed me, he will betray thee;
he will be the death of both of us,&#8221; and dies. Regin returning bids Sigurd roast Fafni's heart, while he sleeps. A prose-piece
tells that Sigurd burnt his fingers by touching the heart, put them in his mouth, and understood the speech of birds. The
advice given him by the birds is taken from two different poems, and partly repeats itself; the substance is a warning to
Sigurd against the treachery plotted by Regin, and a counsel to prevent it by killing him, and so become sole owner of the
hoard. Sigurd takes advantage of the warning: &#8220;Fate shall not be so strong that Regin shall give my death-sentence: both brothers
shall go quickly hence to Hel.&#8221; Regin's enjoyment of the hoard is therefore short. The second half of the story begins when
one of the birds, after a reference to Gudrun, guides Sigurd to the sleeping Valkyrie:

<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e343">&#8220;Bind up the red rings, Sigurd; it is not kingly to fear. I know a maid, fairest of all, decked with gold, if thou couldst
get her. Green roads lead to Giuki's, fate guides the wanderer forward. There a mighty king has a daughter; Sigurd will buy
her with a dowry. There is a hall high on Hindarfell; all without it is swept with fire.... I know a battle-maid who sleeps
on the fell, and the flame plays over her; Odin touched the maid with a thorn, because she laid low others than those he wished
to fall. Thou shalt see, boy, the helmed maid who rode Vingskorni from the fight; Sigrdrifa's sleep cannot be broken, son
of heroes, by the Norns' decrees.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e346">Sigrdrifa (dispenser of victory) is, of course, Brynhild; the name may have been originally an epithet of the Valkyrie, and
it was probably such passages as this that misled the author of <i>Gripisspa</i>  into differentiating the Valkyrie and Brynhild. The last lines have been differently interpreted as a warning to Sigurd
not to seek Brynhild and an attempt to incite him to do so by emphasising the difficulty of the deed; they may merely mean
that her sleep cannot be broken except by one, namely, the one who knows no fear. Brynhild's supernatural origin is clearly
shown here, and also in the prose in <i>Sigrdrifumal. V&ouml;lsunga Saga</i>, though it paraphrases in full the passages relating to the magic sleep, removes much of the mystery surrounding her by providing
her with a genealogy and family connections; while the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i> goes further still in the same direction by leaving out <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e357"></a>Page 21</span>the magic sleep. The change is a natural result of Christian ideas, to which Odin's Wishmaidens would become incomprehensible.


</p>
<p id="d0e359">Thus far the story is that of the release of the enchanted princess, popularly most familiar in the nursery tale of the Sleeping
Beauty. After her broken questions to her deliverer, &#8220;What cut my mail? How have I broken from sleep? Who has flung from me
the dark spells?&#8221; and his answer, &#8220;Sigmund's son and Sigurd's sword,&#8221; she bursts into the famous &#8220;Greeting to the World&#8221;:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e362">&#8220;Long have I slept, long was I sunk in sleep, long are men's misfortunes. It was Odin's doing that I could not break the runes
of sleep. Hail, day! hail, sons of day! hail, night! Look on us two with gracious eyes, and give victory to us who sit here.
Hail, Aesir! hail, Asynjor! hail, Earth, mother of all! give eloquence and wisdom to us the wonderful pair, and hands of healing
while we live.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e365">She then becomes Sigurd's guardian and protectress and the source of his wisdom, as she speaks the runes and counsels which
are to help him in all difficulties; and from this point corresponds to the maiden who is the hero's benefactress, but whom
he deserts through sorcery: the &#8220;Mastermaid&#8221; of the fairy-tales, the Medeia of Greek myth. Gudrun is always an innocent instrument
in drawing Sigurd away from his real bride, the actual agent being her witch-mother Grimhild. This part of the story is summarised
in <i>Gripisspa</i>, except that the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e370"></a>Page 22</span>writer seems unaware that the Wishmaiden who teaches Sigurd &#8220;every mystery that men would know&#8221; and the princess he betrays
are the same:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e373">&#8220;A king's daughter bright in mail sleeps on the fell; thou shalt hew with thy sharp sword, and cut the mail with Fafni's slayer....
She will teach thee every mystery that men would know, and to speak in every man's tongue.... Thou shalt visit Heimi's dwelling
and be the great king's joyous guest.... There is a maid fair to see at Heimi's; men call her Brynhild, Budli's daughter,
but the great king Heimi fosters the proud maid.... Heimi's fair foster-daughter will rob thee of all joy; thou shalt sleep
no sleep, and judge no cause, and care for no man unless thou see the maiden.  ... Ye shall swear all binding oaths but keep
few when thou hast been one night Giuki's guest, thou shalt not remember Heimi's brave foster-daughter.... Thou shalt suffer
treachery from another and pay the price of Grimhild's plots. The bright-haired lady will offer thee her daughter.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e376"><i>V&ouml;lsunga</i> gives additional details: Brynhild knows her deliverer to be Sigurd Sigmundsson and the slayer of Fafni, and they swear oaths
to each other. The description of their second meeting, when he finds her among her maidens, and she prophesies that he will
marry Giuki's daughter, and also the meeting between her and Gudrun before the latter's marriage, represent a later development
of the story, inconsistent with the older conception of the Shield-maiden. Sigurd gives Brynhild the ring Andvaranaut, which
belonged to the hoard, as a pledge, and takes it from her again <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e380"></a>Page 23</span>later when he woos her in Gunnar's form. It is the sight of the ring afterwards on Gudrun's hand which reveals to her the
deception; but the episode has also a deeper significance, since it brings her into connection with the central action by
passing the curse on to her. According to Snorri's paraphrase, Sigurd gives the ring to Brynhild when he goes to her in Gunnar's
form.

</p>
<p id="d0e382">For the rest of the story we must depend chiefly on <i>Gripisspa</i> and <i>V&ouml;lsunga</i>. The latter tells that Grimhild, the mother of the Giukings, gave Sigurd a magic drink by which he forgot Brynhild and fell
in love with Giuki's daughter. Gudrun's brothers swore oaths of friendship with him, and he agreed to ride through the waverlowe,
or ring of fire, disguised and win Brynhild for the eldest brother Gunnar. After the two bridals, he remembered his first
passing through the flame, and his love for Brynhild returned. The Shield-maiden too remembered, but thinking that Gunnar
had fairly won her, accepted her fate until Gudrun in spite and jealousy revealed the trick that had been played on her. Of
the treachery of the Giukings Brynhild takes little heed; but death alone can pay for Sigurd's unconscious betrayal. She tells
Gunnar that Sigurd has broken faith with him, and the Giukings with some reluctance murder their sister's husband. Brynhild
springs on to the funeral pyre, and dies with Sigurd.  <i>V&ouml;lsunga</i> makes the murder take place in <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e393"></a>Page 24</span>Sigurd's chamber, and one poem, the <i>Short Sigurd Lay</i>, agrees. The fragment which follows <i>Sigrdrifumal</i>, on the other hand, places the scene in the open air:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e402">&#8220;Sigurd was slain south of the Rhine; a raven on a tree called aloud: 'On you will Atli redden the sword; your broken oaths
shall destroy you.' Gudrun Giuki's daughter stood without, and these were the first words she spoke: 'Where is now Sigurd,
the lord of men, that my kinsmen ride first?' H&ouml;gni alone made answer: 'We have hewn Sigurd asunder with the sword; the grey
horse still stoops over his dead lord.'&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e405">This agrees with the <i>Old Gudrun Lay</i> and with the Continental German version, as a prose epilogue points out.

</p>
<p id="d0e410">Of the Giuking brothers, Gunnar appears only in a contemptible light: he gains his bride by treachery, and keeps his oath
to Sigurd by a quibble. H&ouml;gni, who has little but his name in common with Hagen von Tronje of the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>, advises Gunnar against breaking his oath, but it is he who taunts Gudrun afterwards. The later poems of the cycle try to
make heroes out of both; the same discrepancy exists between the first and second halves of the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>. Their half-brother, Gutthorm, plays no part in the story except as the actual murderer of Sigurd.

</p>
<p id="d0e418">The chief effect of the influences of Christianity and Romance on the legend is a loss of sympathy <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e420"></a>Page 25</span>with the heroic type of Brynhild, and an attempt to give more dignity to the figure of Gudrun. The Shield-maiden of divine
origin and unearthly wisdom, with her unrelenting vengeance on her beloved, and her contempt for her slighter rival (&#8220;Fitter
would it be for Gudrun to die with Sigurd, if she had a soul like mine&#8221;), is a figure out of harmony with the new religion,
and beyond the comprehension of a time coloured by romance; while both the sentiment and the morality of the age would be
on the side of Gudrun as the formally wedded wife. So the poem known as the <i>Short Sigurd Lay</i>, which has many marks of lateness, such as the elaborate description of the funeral pyre and the exaggeration of the signs
of mourning, says nothing of Sigurd's love for Brynhild, nor do his last words to Gudrun give any hint of it. The <i>Nibelungen Lied</i> suppresses Sigurd's love to Brynhild, and the magic drink, and altogether lowers Brynhild, but elevates Gudrun (under her
mother's name); her slow but terrible vengeance, and absolute forgetfulness of the ties of blood in pursuit of it, are equal
to anything in the original version. The later heroic poems of the Edda make a less successful attempt to create sympathy
for Gudrun; some, such as the so-called <i>First Gudrun Lay</i>, which is entirely romantic in character, try to make her pathetic by the abundance of tears she sheds; others, to make her
heroic, though the result is only a spurious savagery.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e431"></a>Page 26</span></p>
<p id="d0e432">The remaining poems of the cycle, all late in style and tone, deal with the fates of Gudrun and her brothers, and owe their
existence to a narrator's unwillingness to let a favourite story end. The curse makes continuation easy, since the Giukings
inherit it with the hoard. Gudrun was married at the wish of her kinsmen to Atli the Hun, said to be Brynhild's brother. He
invited Gunnar and H&ouml;gni to his court and killed them for the sake of the treasure, in vengeance for which Gudrun killed her
own two sons and Atli; this latter incident being possibly an imitation of Signy. If we may believe that Gudrun, like Chriemhild
in the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>, married Atli in order to gain vengeance for Sigurd, we might suppose that there was confusion here: that she herself incited
the murder of her brothers, and killed Atli when he had served his purpose. This would strengthen the part of Gudrun, who
as the tale stands is rather a futile character. But in all probability the episode is due to a confusion of Signy's story
with that of the German Chriemhild and Etzel.

</p>
<p id="d0e437">One point has still to be considered: the place of the Nibelungs in the story. In the Edda, the Hniflungs are always the Giukings,
Gunnar and H&ouml;gni, and Snorri gives it as the name of an heroic family. The title of the first <i>aventiure</i> of the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i> also apparently uses the word of the Burgundians. Yet the treasure is always the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e445"></a>Page 27</span>Nibelungs' hoard, which clearly means that they were the original owners; and when Hagen von Tronje tells the story later
in the poem, he speaks of the Nibelungs correctly as the dwarfs from whom Siegfried won it. On this point, therefore, the
German preserves the older tradition: the Norse Andvari, the river-dwarf, is the German Alberich the Nibelung. In the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i> the winning of the treasure forms no part of the action: it is merely narrated by Hagen. This accounts for the shortening
of the episode and the omission of the intermediate steps: the robbing of the dwarf, the curse, and the dragon-slaying.

</p>
<p id="d0e450"><b>Ermanric.&#8212;</b>The two poems of <i>Gudrun's Lament</i> and <i>Hamthismal</i>, in the Edda attached to the Volsung cycle, belong correctly to that of the Gothic hero Ermanric. According to these poems,
Gudrun, Giuki's daughter, married a third time, and had three sons, S&ouml;rli, Hamthi and Erp. She married Svanhild, her own and
Sigurd's daughter, to J&ouml;rmunrek, king of the Goths; but Svanhild was slandered, and her husband had her trodden to death by
horses' hoofs. The description of Svanhild is a good example of the style of the romantic poems:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e461">&#8220;The bondmaids sat round Svanhild, dearest of my children; Svanhild was like a glorious sunbeam in my hall. I dowered her
with gold and goodly fabrics <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e463"></a>Page 28</span>when I married her into Gothland. That was the hardest of my griefs, when they trod Svanhild's fair hair into the dust beneath
the horses' hoofs.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e466">Gudrun sent her three sons to avenge their sister; two of them slew Erp by the way, and were killed themselves in their attack
on J&ouml;rmunrek for want of his help. So died, as Snorri says, all who were of Giuking descent; and only Aslaug, daughter of
Sigurd and Brynhild, survived. <i>Heimskringla</i>, a thirteenth century history of the royal races of Scandinavia, traces the descent of the Norse kings from her.

</p>
<p id="d0e471">This Ermanric story, which belongs to legendary history rather than myth, is in reality quite independent of the Volsung or
Nibelung cycle. The connection is loose and inartistic, the legend being probably linked to Gudrun's name because she had
become a favourite character and Icelandic narrators were unwilling to let her die. The historic Ermanric was conquered by
the Huns in 374; the sixth century historian Jornandes is the earliest authority for the tradition that he was murdered by
Sarus and Ammius in revenge for their sister's death by wild horses. Saxo also tells the story, with greater similarity of
names. It seems hardly necessary to assume, with many scholars, the existence of two heroes of the name Ermanric, an historic
and a mythical one. A simpler explanation is that a legendary story <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e473"></a>Page 29</span>became connected with the name of a real personage. The slaying of Erp introduces a common folk-tale incident, familiar in
stories like the <i>Golden Bird</i>, told by both Asbj&ouml;rnsen and Grimm.

</p>
<p id="d0e478"><b>Helgi.</b>&#8212;The Helgi-lays, three in number, are the best of the heroic poems. Nominally they tell two stories, Helgi Hj&ouml;rvardsson being
sandwiched between the two poems of Helgi Hundingsbane; but essentially the stories are the same.

</p>
<p id="d0e482">In <i>Helyi Hj&ouml;rvardsson</i>, Helgi, son of Hj&ouml;rvard and Sigrlinn, was dumb and nameless until a certain day when, while sitting on a howe, he saw a troop
of nine Valkyries. The fairest, Svava, Eylimi's daughter, named him, and bidding him avenge his grandfather on Hrodmar (a
former wooer of Sigrlinn's, and her father's slayer), sent him to find a magic sword. Helgi slew Hrodmar and married Svava,
having escaped from the sea-giantess Hrimgerd through the protection of his Valkyrie bride and the wit of a faithful servant.
His brother Hedin, through the spells of a troll-wife, swore to wed Helgi's bride. Repenting, he told his brother, who, dying
in a fight with Hrodmar's son, charged Svava to marry Hedin. A note by the collector adds &#8220;Helgi and Svava are said to have
been born again.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e487">In <i>Helgi Hundingsbane I</i>., Helgi is the son of Sigmund and Borghild. He fought and slew <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e492"></a>Page 30</span>Hunding, and afterwards met in battle Hunding's sons at Logafell, where the Valkyrie Sigrun, H&ouml;gni's daughter, protected him,
and challenged him to fight H&ouml;dbrodd to whom her father had plighted her. She protected his ships in the storm which overtook
them as they sailed to meet H&ouml;dbrodd, and watched over him in the battle, in which he slew his rival and was greeted as victor
by Sigrun: &#8220;Hail, hero of Yngvi's race ... thou shalt have both the red rings and the mighty maid: thine are H&ouml;gni's daughter
and Hringstad, the victory and the land.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e494"><i>Helgi Hundingsbane II</i>., besides giving additional details of the hero's early life, completes the story. In the battle with H&ouml;dbrodd, Helgi killed
all Sigrun's kinsmen except one brother, Dag, who slew him later in vengeance. But Helgi returned from the grave, awakened
by Sigrun's weeping, and she went into the howe with him. The collector again adds a note: &#8220;Helgi and Sigrun are said to have
been born again: he was then called Helgi Haddingjaskati, and she Kara Halfdan's daughter, as it is told in the Kara-ljod,
and she was a Valkyrie.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e498">This third Helgi legend does not survive in verse, the <i>Kara-ljod</i> having perished. It is told in prose in the late saga of Hromund Gripsson, according to which Kara was a Valkyrie and swan-maid:
while she was hovering over Helgi, he killed her accidentally in swinging his sword.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e503"></a>Page 31</span></p>
<p id="d0e504">There can be little doubt that these three are merely variants of the same story; the foundation is the same, though incidents
and names differ. The three Helgis are one hero, and the three versions of his legend probably come from different localities.
The collector could not but feel their identity, and the similarity was too fundamental to be overlooked; he therefore accounted
for it by the old idea of re-birth, and thus linked the three together. In each Helgi has an hereditary foe (Hrodmar, Hunding,
or Hadding); in each his bride is a Valkyrie, who protects him and gives him victory; each ends in tragedy, though differently.

</p>
<p id="d0e506">The two variants in the Poetic Edda have evident marks of contamination with the Volsung cycle, and some points of superficial
resemblance. Helgi Hj&ouml;rvardsson's mother is Sigrlinn, Helgi Hundings-bane's father is Sigmund, as in the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>  Siegfried is the son of Sigemunt and Sigelint. Helgi Hundingsbane is a Volsung and Wolfing (Ylfing), and brother to Sinfj&ouml;tli;
his first fight, like Sigurd's, is against the race of Hunding; his rival, H&ouml;dbrodd, is a Hniflung; he first meets the Valkyrie
on Loga-fell (Flame-hill); he is killed by his brother-in-law, who has sworn friendship. But there is no parallel to the essential
features of the Volsung cycle, and such likenesses between the two stories as are not accidental are due to the influence
of the more favoured legend; this is especially true <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e511"></a>Page 32</span>of the names. The prose-piece <i>Sinfj&ouml;tli's Death</i> also makes Helgi half-brother to Sinfj&ouml;tli; it is followed in this by <i>V&ouml;lsunga Saga</i>, which devotes a chapter to Helgi, paraphrasing <i>Helyi Hundingsbane I</i>. There is, of course, confusion over the Hunding episode; the saga is obliged to reconcile its conflicting authorities by
making Helgi kill Hunding and some of his sons, and Sigurd kill the rest.

</p>
<p id="d0e522">If the theory stated below as to the original Helgi legend be correct, the feud with Hunding's race, as told in these poems,
must be extraneous. I conjecture that it belonged originally to the Volsung cycle, and to the wer-wolf Sinfj&ouml;tli. It must
not be forgotten that, though he passes out of the Volsung story altogether in the later versions, both Scandinavian and German,
he is in the main action in the earliest one (that in <i>Beowulf</i>), where even Sigurd does not appear. The feud might easily have been transferred from him to Helgi as well as to Sigurd,
for invention is limited as regards episodes, and a narrator who wishes to elaborate the story of a favourite hero is often
forced to borrow adventures. In the original story, Helgi's blood-feud was probably with the kindred of Sigrun or Svava.

</p>
<p id="d0e527">The origin of the Helgi legend must be sought outside of the Volsung cycle. Some writers are of opinion that the name should
be Holgi, and there are two stories in which a hero Holgi appears. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e529"></a>Page 33</span>With the legend of Thorgerd Holgabrud, told by Saxo, who identified it with that of Helgi Hundingsbane, it has nothing in
common; and the connection which has been sought with the legend of Holger Danske is equally difficult to establish. The essence
of this latter story is the hero's disappearance into fairyland, and the expectation of his return sometime in the future:
a motive which has been very fruitful in Irish romance, and in the traditions of Arthur, Tryggvason, and Barbarossa, among
countless others. But it is absent from the Helgi poems; and the &#8220;old wives' tales&#8221; of Helgi's re-birth have nothing to do
with his legend, but are merely a bookman's attempt to connect stories which he felt to be the same though different.

</p>
<p id="d0e531">The essential feature of the story told in these poems is the motive familiar in that class of ballads of which the <i>Douglas Tragedy</i> is a type: the hero loves the daughter of his enemy's house, her kinsmen kill him, and she dies of grief. This is the story
told in both the lays of <i>Helgi Hundingsbane</i>, complete in one, unfinished in the other. No single poem preserves all the incidents of the legend; some survive in one
version, some in another, as usual in ballad literature.

</p>
<p id="d0e539">Like Sinfj&ouml;tli and Sigurd, Helgi is brought up in obscurity. He spends his childhood disguised in his enemy's household, and
on leaving it, sends a message to tell his foes whom they have fostered. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e541"></a>Page 34</span>They pursue him, and he is obliged, like Gude Wallace in the Scottish ballad, to disguise himself in a bondmaid's dress:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e544">&#8220;Piercing are the eyes of Hagal's bondmaid; it is no peasant's kin who stands at the mill: the stones are split, the bin springs
in two. It is a hard fate for a warrior to grind the barley; the sword-hilt is better fitted for those hands than the mill-handle.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e547">Sigrun is present at the battle, in which, as in the English and Scottish ballads, Helgi slays all her kindred except one
brother. He tells her the fortunes of the fight, and she chooses between lover and kinsmen:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e550"><span class="smallcaps">Helgi</span>. &#8220;Good luck is not granted thee, maid, in all things, though the Norns are partly to blame. Bragi and H&ouml;gni fell to-day at
Frekastein, and I was their slayer;... most of thy kindred lie low. Thou couldst not hinder the battle: it was thy fate to
be a cause of strife to heroes. Weep not, Sigrun, thou hast been Hild to us; heroes must meet their fate.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e554"><span class="smallcaps">Sigrun</span>. &#8220;I could wish those alive who are fallen, and yet rest in thy arms.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e559">The surviving brother, Dag, swears oaths of reconciliation to Helgi, but remembers the feud. The end comes, as in the Norse
Sigmund tale, through Odin's interference: he lends his spear to Dag, who stabs Helgi in a grove, and rides home to tell his
sister. Sigrun is inconsolable, and curses the murderer with a rare power and directness:
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e561"></a>Page 35</span>
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e564">&#8220;May the oaths pierce thee that thou hast sworn to Helgi.... May the ship sail not that sails under thee, though a fair wind
lie behind. May the horse run not that runs under thee, though thou art fleeing from thy foes. May the sword bite not that
thou drawest, unless it sing round thine own head. If thou wert an outlaw in the woods, Helgi's death were avenged.... Never
again while I live, by night or day, shall I sit happy at Sevafell, if I see not the light play on my hero's company, nor
the gold-bitted War-breeze run thither with the warrior.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e567">But Helgi returns from the grave, unable to rest because of Sigrun's weeping, and she goes down into the howe with him:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e570"><span class="smallcaps">Sigrun</span>. &#8220;Thy hair is covered with frost, Helgi; thou art drenched with deadly dew, thy hands are cold and wet. How shall I get thee
help, my hero?&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e574"><span class="smallcaps">Helgi</span>. &#8220;Thou alone hast caused it, Sigrun from Sevafell, that Helgi is drenched with deadly dew. Thou weepest bitter tears before
thou goest to sleep, gold-decked, sunbright, Southern maid; each one falls on my breast, bloody, cold and wet, cruel, heavy
with grief....&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e578"><span class="smallcaps">Sigrun</span>. &#8220;I have made thee here a painless bed, Helgi, son of the Wolfings. I will sleep in thy arms, my warrior, as if thou wert
alive.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e582"><span class="smallcaps">Helgi</span>. &#8220;There shall be no stranger thing at Sevafell, early or late, than that thou, king-born, H&ouml;gni's fair daughter, shouldst
be alive in the grave and sleep in a dead man's arms.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e587">The lay of Helgi Hj&ouml;rvardsson is furthest from the original, for there is no feud with Svava's kindred, nor does Helgi die
at their hands; but it <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e589"></a>Page 36</span>preserves a feature omitted elsewhere, in his leaving his bride to his brother's protection. Like the wife in the English
ballad of <i>Earl Brand</i>, and the heroine of the Danish <i>Ribold and Guldborg</i>, Svava refuses, but Hedin's last words seem to imply that he is to return and marry her after avenging Helgi. This would
be contrary to all parallels, according to which Svava should die with Helgi.

</p>
<p id="d0e597">The alternative ending of the <i>Helgi and Kara</i>  version is interesting as providing the possible source of another Scottish ballad dealing with the same type of story.
In <i>The Cruel Knight</i>, as here, the hero slays his bride, who is of a hostile family, by mistake. One passage of <i>Helgi Hundingsbane II.</i>  describes Helgi's entrance into Valhalla, which, taken with the incident of Sigrun's joining him in the howe, supplies an
instance of the survival side by side of inconsistent notions as to the state of the dead. The lover's return from the grave
is the subject of <i>Clerk Saunders</i> (the second part) and several other Scottish ballads.

</p>
<p id="d0e611"><b>The Song of the Mill</b>.&#8212;The magic mill is best known in the folk-tale, &#8220;Why the sea is salt&#8221;; but this is not the oldest part of the story, though
it took most hold of the popular imagination which loves legendary explanations of natural phenomena. The hero, Frodi, a mythical
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e615"></a>Page 37</span>Danish king, is the northern Croesus. His reign was marked by a world-peace, and the peace, the wealth, the liberality of
Frodi became proverbial. The motive of his tale is again the curse that follows gold. It is told by Snorri, in whose work
<i>Grottas&ouml;ngr</i> is embodied.

</p>
<p id="d0e620">Frodi possessed two magic quern-stones, from which the grinder could grind out whatever he wished; but he had no one strong
enough to turn them until he bought in Sweden two bondmaids of giant-race, Menja and Fenja. He set them to grind at the quern
by day, and by night when all slept, and as they ground him gold, and peace, and prosperity, they sang:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e623">&#8220;We grind wealth for Frodi, all bliss we grind, and abundance of riches in the fortunate bin. May he sit on wealth, may he
sleep on down, may he wake to delight; then the grinding were good. Here shall no man hurt another, prepare evil nor work
death, nor hew with the keen sword though he find his brother's slayer bound.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e626">But when they wearied of their toil and asked for a little rest, Frodi answered: &#8220;Ye shall sleep no longer than the cuckoo
is silent, or while I speak one stave.&#8221; Then the giant-maids grew angry, and sang:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e629">&#8220;Thou wert not wise, Frodi, in buying thy bondmaids: thou didst choose us for our strength and size but asked not our race.
Bold were Hrungni and his father, and mightier Thiazi; Idi and Orni were our <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e631"></a>Page 38</span>ancestors, from them are we daughters of the mountain-giants sprung.... We maids wrought mighty deeds, we moved the mountains
from their places, we rolled rocks over the court of the giants, so that the earth shook.... Now we are come to the king's
house, meeting no mercy and held in bondage, mud beneath our feet and cold over our heads, we grind the Peace-maker. It is
dreary at Frodi's.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e634">As they sang of their wrongs by night, their mood changed, and instead of grinding peace and wealth, they ground war, fire
and sword:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e637">&#8220;Waken, Frodi! waken, Frodi! if thou wilt hear our songs.... I see fire burn at the east of the citadel, the voice of war
awakes, the signal is given. A host will come hither in speed, and burn the hall over the king.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e640">So the bondmaids ground on in giant-wrath, while the sea-king Mysing sailed nearer with his host, until the quern-stones split;
and then the daughters of the mountain-giants spoke once more: &#8220;We have ground to our pleasure, Frodi; we maids have stood
long at the mill.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e642">A Norseman was rarely content to allow a fortunate ending to any hero, and a continuation of the story therefore makes the
mill bring disaster on Mysing also. After slaying Frodi and burning his hall, he took the stones and the bondmaids on board
his ship, and bade them grind salt. They ground till the weight sank the ship to the bottom of the sea, where the mill is
grinding still. This is not in the song, though it has lived longer popularly <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e644"></a>Page 39</span>than the earlier part. Dr. Rydberg identities Frodi with Frey, the God of fertility.

</p>
<p id="d0e646"><b>The Everlasting Battle</b>.&#8212;No Eddic poem survives on the battle of the Hjathnings, the story of which is told in prose by Snorri. It must, however,
be an ancient legend; and the hero Hedin belongs to one of the old Germanic heroic races, for the minstrel Deor is a dependent
of the Heodenings in the Old English poem to which reference will be made later. The legend is that Hild, daughter of H&ouml;gni,
was carried away by Hedin the Hjathning, Hjarrandi's son. H&ouml;gni pursued, and overtook them near the Orkneys. Then Hild went
to her father and offered atonement from Hedin, but said also that he was quite ready to fight, and H&ouml;gni need expect no mercy.
H&ouml;gni answered shortly, and Hild returning told Hedin that her father would accept no atonement but bade him prepare to fight.
Both kings landed on an island, followed by their men. Hedin called to H&ouml;gni and offered atonement and much gold, but H&ouml;gni
said it was too late, his sword was already drawn. They fought till evening, and then returned to their ships; but Hild went
on shore and woke up all the slain by sorcery, so that the battle began again next day just as before. Every day they fight,
and every night the dead are recalled to life, and so it will go on till Ragnar&ouml;k.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e650"></a>Page 40</span></p>
<p id="d0e651">In the German poem, <i>Gudrun</i>, the Continental version of this legend occurs in the story of the second Hilde. She is carried away by the minstrel Horant
(who thus plays a more active part than the Norse Hjarrandi), as envoy from King Hettel, Hedin's German counterpart. Her father
Hagen pursues, and after a battle with Hettel agrees to a reconciliation. The story is duplicated in the abduction of Hilde's
daughter Gudrun, and the battle on the W&uuml;lpensand.

</p>
<p id="d0e656">Another reference may probably be supplied by the much debated lines 14&#8211;16 from the Anglo-Saxon <i>Deor</i>, of which the most satisfactory translation seems to be: &#8220;Many of us have heard of the harm of Hild; the Jute's loves were
unbounded, so that the care of love took from him sleep altogether.&#8221; Saxo, it is true, makes Hild's father a Jute, instead
of her lover, and Snorri apparently agrees with him in making Hedin Norwegian; but in the <i>Gudrun</i>  Hettel is Frisian or Jutish. The Anglo-Saxon <i>Widsith</i> mentions in one line Hagena, king of the Holmrygas (a Norwegian province), and Heoden, king of the Glommas (not identified),
who may be the H&ouml;gni and Hedin of this tale.

</p>
<p id="d0e667">The Anglo-Saxon and German agree on another point where both differ from the Norse. The Anglo-Saxon poem <i>Deor</i> is supposed to be spoken by a <i>scop</i> or court poet who has been ousted from the favour of his lord, a Heodening, by Heorrenda, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e675"></a>Page 41</span>another singer: &#8220;Once I was the Heodenings' scop, dear to my lord: Deor was my name. Many a year I had a good service and
a gracious lord, until the song-skilled Hoerrenda received the rights which the protector of men once granted me.&#8221; Like Heorrenda,
Horant in the <i>Gudrun</i> is a singer in the service of the Heathnings. The Norse version keeps the name, and its connection with the Heathnings, but
gives Hjarrandi, as the hero's father, no active part to play. In both points, arguing from the probable Frisian origin of
the story, the Anglo-Saxon and German are more likely to have the correct form.

</p>
<p id="d0e680">The legend is, like those of Walter and Hildigund, Helgi and Sigrun, founded on the primary instincts of love and war. In
the Norse story of the Heathnings, however, the former element is almost eliminated. It is from no love to Hedin that Hild
accompanies him, though Saxo would have it so. Nothing is clearer than that strife is her only object. It is her mediation
which brings about the battle, when apparently both heroes would be quite willing to make peace; and her arts which cause
the daily renewal of fighting. This island battle among dead and living is peculiar to the Norse version, and coloured by,
if not originating in, the Valhalla idea: H&ouml;gni and Hedin and their men are the Einherjar who fight every day and rest and
feast at night, Hild is a war-goddess. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e682"></a>Page 42</span>The conception of her character, contrasting with the gentler part played by the Continental German heroines (who are rather
the causes than the inciters of strife), can be paralleled from many of the sagas proper.

</p>
<p id="d0e684">H&ouml;gni's sword Dainsleif, forged by the dwarfs, as were all magic weapons, is like the sword of Angantyr, in that it claims
a victim whenever it is drawn from the sheath: an idea which may easily have arisen from the prowess of any famous swordsman.


</p>
<p id="d0e686"><b>The Sword of Angantyr</b>.&#8212;Like the two last legends, Angantyr's story is not represented in the Elder Edda; it is not even told by Snorri. Yet poems
belonging to the cycle survive (preserved by good fortune in the late mythical <i>Hervarar Saga</i>)  which among the heroic poems rank next in artistic beauty to the Helgi Lays. Since the story possesses besides a striking
originality, and is connected with the name of a Pan-Germanic hero, the Ongendtheow of Old English poetry, I cannot follow
the example of most editors and omit it from the heroic poems.

</p>
<p id="d0e693">Like the Volsung legend it is the story of a curse; and there is a general similarity of outline, with the exception that
the hero is in this case a woman. The curse-laden treasure is here the sword Tyrfing, which Svafrlami got by force from <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e695"></a>Page 43</span>the dwarfs. They laid a curse on it: that it should bring death to its bearer, no wound it made should be healed, and it should
claim a victim whenever it was unsheathed. In the saga, the story is spread over several generations: partly, no doubt, in
order to include varying versions; partly also in imitation of the true Icelandic family saga. The chief actors in the legend,
beside the sword, are Angantyr and his daughter Herv&ouml;r.

</p>
<p id="d0e697">The earlier history of Tyrfing is told in the saga. Svafrlami is killed, with the magic weapon itself, by the viking Arngrim,
who thus gains possession of it; when he is slain in his turn, it descends to Angantyr, the eldest of his twelve berserk sons.
For a while no one can withstand them, but the doom overtakes them at last in the battle of Samsey against the Swedes Arrow-Odd
and Hjalmar. In berserk-rage, the twelve brothers attack the Swedish ships, and slay every man except the two leaders who
have landed on the island. The battle over, the berserks go ashore, and there when their fury is past, they are attacked by
the two Swedish champions. Odd fights eleven of the brothers, but Hjalmar has the harder task in meeting Angantyr and his
sword. All the twelve sons of Arngrim fall, and Hjalmar is mortally wounded by Tyrfing. The survivor buries his twelve foemen
where they fell, and takes his comrade's body back to Sweden. The first poem gives the challenge <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e699"></a>Page 44</span>of the Swedish champions, and Hjalmar's dying song.

</p>
<p id="d0e701">Herv&ouml;r, the daughter of Angantyr, is in some respects a female counterpart of Sigurd. Like him, she is born after her father's
death, and brought up in obscurity. When she learns her father's name, she goes forth without delay to claim her inheritance
from the dead, even with the curse that goes with it. Here the second poem begins. On reaching the island where her father
fell, she asks a shepherd to guide her to the graves of Arngrim's sons:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e704">&#8220;I will ask no hospitality, for I know not the islanders; tell me quickly, where are the graves called Hj&ouml;rvard's howes?&#8221;</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e707">He is unwilling: &#8220;The man is foolish who comes here alone in the dark shade of night: fire is flickering, howes are opening,
field and fen are aflame,&#8221; and flees into the woods, but Herv&ouml;r is dauntless and goes on alone. She reaches the howes, and
calls on the sons of Arngrim:

</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e710">&#8220;Awake, Angantyr! Herv&ouml;r calls thee, only daughter to thee and Tofa. Give me from the howe the keen sword which the dwarfs
forged for Svafrlami, Hervard, Hj&ouml;rvard, Hrani, Angantyr! I call you all from below the tree-roots, with helm and corselet,
with sharp sword, shield and harness, and reddened spear.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e713">Angantyr denies that the sword is in his howe: &#8220;Neither father, son, nor other kinsmen buried me; my slayers had Tyrfing;&#8221;
but Herv&ouml;r does <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e715"></a>Page 45</span>not believe him. &#8220;Tell me but truth.... Thou art slow to give thine only child her heritage.&#8221; He tries to frighten her back
to the ships by describing the sights she will see, but she only cries again, &#8220;Give me Hjalmar's slayer from the howe, Angantyr!&#8221;


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p id="d0e718">A. &#8220;Hjalmar's slayer lies under my shoulders; it is all wrapped in fire; I know no maid on earth who dare take that sword
in her hands.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e720">H. &#8220;I will take the sharp sword in my hands, if I can get it: I fear no burning fire, the flame sinks as I look on it.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e722">A. &#8220;Foolish art thou, Herv&ouml;r the fearless, to rush into the fire open-eyed. I will rather give thee the sword from the howe,
young maid; I cannot refuse thee.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e724">H. &#8220;Thou dost well, son of vikings, to give me the sword from the howe. I think its possession better than to win all Norway.&#8221;</p>
</div><p>

</p>
<p id="d0e727">Her father warns her of the curse, and the doom that the sword will bring, and she leaves the howes followed by his vain wish:
&#8220;Would that I could give thee the lives of us twelve, the strength and energy that we sons of Arngrim left behind us!&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e729">It is unnecessary here to continue the story as the saga does, working out the doom over later generations; over Herv&ouml;r's
son Heidrek, who forfeited his head to Odin in a riddle-contest, and over his children, another Angantyr, Hlod, and a second
Herv&ouml;r. The verse sources for this latter part are very corrupt.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e731"></a>Page 46</span></p>
<p id="d0e732">A full discussion of the relation between the Eddic and the Continental versions of the heroic tales summarised in the foregoing
pages would, of course, be far beyond the scope of this study; the utmost that can be done in that direction is to suggest
a few points. Three of the stories are not concerned in this section: Helgi and Frodi are purely Scandinavian cycles; while
though Angantyr is a well-known heroic name (in <i>Widsith</i> Ongendtheow is king of the Swedes), the legend attached to his name in the Norse sources does not survive elsewhere. The
Weland cycle is perhaps common property. None of the versions localise it, for the names in <i>V&ouml;lundarkvida</i>, Wolfdale, Myrkwood, &amp;c., are conventional heroic place-names. It was popular at a very early date in England, and is probably
a Pan-Germanic legend. The Sigurd and Hild stories, on the contrary, are both, in all versions, localised on the Continent,
the former by the Rhine, the latter in Friesland or Jutland; both, therefore, in Low German country, whence they must have
spread to the other Germanic lands. To England they were doubtless carried by the Low German invaders of the sixth century.
On the question of their passage to the North there are wide differences of opinion. Most scholars agree that there was an
earlier and a later passage, the first taking Hild, Ermanric, and the Volsung story; the second, about the twelfth or thirteenth
century, the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e740"></a>Page 47</span>Volsungs again, with perhaps Dietrich and Attila. But there is much disagreement as to the date of the first transmission.
M&uuml;llenhoff put it as early as 600; Konrad Maurer, in the ninth and tenth centuries; while Dr. Golther is of opinion that the
Volsung story passed first to the vikings in France, and then westward over Ireland to Iceland; therefore also not before
the ninth century. Such evidence as is afforded by the very slight English references makes it probable that the Scandinavians
had the tales later than the English, a view supported by the more highly developed form of the Norse version, and, in the
case of the Volsung cycle, its greater likeness to the Continental German. The earliest Norse references which can be approximately
dated are in the Skald Bragi (first half of the ninth century), who knew all three stories: the Hild and Ermanric tales he
gives in outline; his only reference to the Volsungs is a kenning, &#8220;the Volsungs' drink,&#8221; for serpent. With the possible exception
of the Anglo-Saxon fragments, the Edda preserves on the whole the purest versions of those stories which are common to all,
though, as might be expected, the Continental sources sometimes show greater originality in isolated details. These German
sources have entangled the different cycles into one involved mass; but in the Norse the extraneous elements are easily detached.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e742"></a>Page 48</span></p>
<p id="d0e743">The motives of heroic tales are limited in number and more or less common to different races. Heroic cycles differ as a rule
merely in their choice or combination of incidents, not in the nature of their material. The origin of these heroic motives
may generally be found in primitive custom or conditions of life, seized by an imaginative people and woven into legend; sometimes
linked to the name of some dead tribal hero, just as the poets of a later date wound the same traditions in still-varying
combinations round the names of Gretti Asmundarson and Gold-Thori; though often the hero is, like the Gods, born of the myth.
In the latter case, the story is pure myth; in the former it is legend, or a mixture of history and legend, as in the Ermanric
and Dietrich tales, which have less interest for the mythologist.

</p>
<p id="d0e745">The curse-bringing treasure, one of the most fruitful Germanic motives, probably has its origin in the custom of burying a
dead man's possessions with him. In the <i>Waterdale Saga</i>, Ketil Raum, a viking of the eighth and early ninth centuries, reproaches his son Thorstein as a degenerate, in that he expects
to inherit his father's wealth, instead of winning fortune for himself: &#8220;It used to be the custom with kings and earls, men
of our kind, that they won for themselves fortune and fame; wealth was not counted as a heritage, nor would sons inherit from
their fathers, but rather <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e750"></a>Page 49</span>lay their possessions in the howe with them.&#8221; It is easy to see that when this custom came into conflict with the son's natural
desire to inherit, the sacrosanctity of the dead man's treasure and of his burial-mound would be their only protection against
violation. The fear of the consequences of breaking the custom took form in the myth of the curse, as in the sword of Angantyr
and the Nibelungs' hoard; while the dangers attending the violation of the howe were personified in the dragon-guardian. In
<i>Gold-Thori's Saga</i>, the dead berserks whose howe Thori enters, are found guarding their treasure in the shape of dragons; while Thori himself
is said to have turned into a dragon after death.

</p>
<p id="d0e755">Marriage with alien wives, which in the case of the Mastermaid story has been postulated as means of transmission and as the
one possible explanation of its nearly universal diffusion, may perhaps with more simplicity be assumed as the common basis
in custom for independently arising myths of this type. The attempts of the bride's kindred to prevent the marriage, and of
the bridegroom's to undo it, would be natural incidents in such a story, and the magic powers employed by and against the
bride would be the mythical representatives of the mutually unfamiliar customs of alien tribes. This theory at least offers
a credible explanation of the hero's temporary oblivion of or unfaithfulness <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e757"></a>Page 50</span>to his protectress, after their successful escape together.

</p>
<p id="d0e759">In the Valkyrie-brides, Brynhild and Sigrun, with their double attributes of fighting and wisdom, there is an evident connexion
with the Germanic type of woman preserved in the allusions of C&aelig;sar and Tacitus, which reaches its highest development in
the heroines of the Edda. Any mythical or ideal conception of womanhood combines the two primitive instincts, love and fighting,
even though the woman may be only the innocent cause of strife, or its passive prize. The peculiarity of the Germanic representation
is that the woman is never passive, but is herself the incarnation of both instincts. Even if she is not a Valkyrie, nor taking
part herself in the fight, she is ready, like the wives of the Cimbri, to drive the men back to the battle from which they
have escaped. Hild and Herv&ouml;r are at one extreme: war is their spiritual life. Love is in Hild nothing more than instinct;
in Herv&ouml;r it is not even that: she would desire nothing from marriage beyond a son to inherit the sword. At the other extreme
is Sigrun, who has the warlike instinct, but is spiritually a lover as completely and essentially as Isolde or Juliet. The
interest in Signy lies in the way in which she sacrifices what are usually considered the strongest feminine instincts, without,
however, by any means abandoning them, to her uncompromising <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e761"></a>Page 51</span>revenge and pride of race. Her pride in her son seems to include something of both trains of feeling; and she dies with the
husband she detests, simply because he is her husband. Brynhild, lastly, is a highly modern type, as independent in love as
in war. It is impossible to imagine Sigrun, or Wagner's Sieglinde, taking her revenge on a faithless lover; from no lack of
spirit, but simply because revenge would have given no comfort to either. To Brynhild it is not only a distinct relief, but
the only endurable end; she can forgive when she is avenged.

</p>
<p id="d0e763">The other motives of these stories may be briefly enumerated. The burning of Brynhild and Signy, and Sigrun's entrance into
the howe, are mythical reminiscences of widow-burial. The &#8220;sister's son&#8221; is preserved in the Sigmund and Sinfj&ouml;tli tale, which
also has a trace of animism in the werwolf episode. The common swanmaid motive occurs in two, the V&ouml;lund story and the legend
of Helgi and Kara; while the first Helgi tale suggests the Levirate in the proposed marriage of Svava to her husband's brother.
The waverlowe of the Volsung myth may be traced back to the midsummer fires; the wooing of Brynhild by Sigurd's crossing the
fire would thus, like the similar bridal of Menglad and Svipdag and the winning of Gerd for Frey, be based on the marriages
which formed a part of agricultural rites.

</p>
<p id="d0e929">Saxo Grammaticus (Book vii.) tells the story of a Signy, daughter of Sigar, whose lover Hagbard, after slaying her brothers,
wins her favour. Sigar in vengeance had him strangled on a hill in view of Signy's windows, and she set fire to her house
that she might die simultaneously with her lover. The antiquity of part at least of this story is proved by the kenning &#8220;Hagbard's
collar&#8221; for halter, in a poem probably of the tenth century. On the other hand, a reference in <i>V&ouml;lsunga Saga</i>, that &#8220;Haki and Hagbard were great and famous men, yet Sigar carried off their sister, ... and they were slow to vengeance,&#8221;
shows that there is confusion somewhere. It seems possible that Hagbard's story has been contaminated with a distorted account
of the Volsung Signy, civilised as usual by Saxo, with an effect of vulgarity absent from the primitive story.

</p>
<p id="d0e934">In a recently published pamphlet by Mr. W.W. Lawrence and Dr. W.H. Schofield (<i>The First Riddle of Cynewulf</i> and <i>Signy's Lament</i>. Baltimore: The Modern Language Association of America. 1902) it is suggested that the so-called First Riddle in the Exeter
Book is in reality an Anglo-Saxon translation of a Norse &#8220;Complaint&#8221; spoken by the Volsung Signy. Evidence from metre and
form is all in favour of this view, and the poem bears the interpretation without any straining of the meaning. Dr. Schofield's
second contention, that the poem thus interpreted is evidence for the theory of a British origin for the Eddie poems, is not
equally convincing. The existence in Anglo-Saxon of a translation from the Norse is no proof that any of the Eddie poems,
or even the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e942"></a>Page 55</span>original Norse &#8220;Signy's Lament&#8221; postulated by Dr. Schofield, were composed in the West.

</p>
<p id="d0e944">It seems unnecessary to suppose, with Dr. Schofield, an influence of British legend on the Volsung story. The points in which
the story of Sigmund resembles that of Arthur and differs from that of Theseus prove nothing in the face of equally strong
points of correspondence between Arthur and Theseus which are absent from the Volsung story.

</p>
<p id="d0e953">Munch (<i>Nordm&aelig;ndenes Gudel&aelig;re</i>, Christiania, 1847) ingeniously identified the old man with Odin, come in person to conduct Sinfj&ouml;tli to Valhalla, since
he would otherwise have gone to Hel, not having fallen in battle; a stratagem quite in harmony with Odin's traditional character.

</p>
<p id="d0e965">It seems probable, on the evidence of <i>Beowulf</i>, that Sigmund and Sinfj&ouml;tli represent the Pan-Germanic stage of the national-hero, and Sigurd or Siegfried the Continental
stage. Possibly Helgi may then be the Norse race-hero. Sigurd was certainly foreign to Scandinavia; hence the epithet Hunnish,
constantly applied to him, and the localising of the legend by the Rhine. The possibility suggests itself that the Brynhild
part of the story, on the other hand, is of Scandinavian origin, and thence passed to Germany. It is at least curious that
the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>  places Prunhilt in Iceland.

</p>
<p id="d0e980">Wagner's <i>Ring des Nibelungen</i> is remarkable not only for the way in which it reproduces the spirit of both the Sinfj&ouml;tli and the Sigurd traditions, but
also for the wonderful instinct which chooses the best and most <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e985"></a>Page 56</span>primitive features of both Norse and Continental versions. Thus he keeps the dragon of the Norse, the Nibelungs of the German;
preserves the wildness of the old Sigmund tale, and substitutes the German Hagen for his paler Norse namesake; restores the
original balance between the parts of Brynhild and Gudrun; gives the latter character, and an active instead of a passive
function in the story, by assigning to her her mother's share in the action; and by substituting for the slaying of the otter
the bargain with the Giants for the building of Valhalla, makes the cause worthy of the catastrophe.

</p>
<p id="d0e1032">Dr. Storm has an interesting article on the Norse belief in Re-birth in the <i>Arkiv for Nordisk Filologi</i>, ix. He collects instances, and among other arguments points out the Norse custom of naming a posthumous child after its
dead father as a probable relic of the belief. The inheritance of luck may perhaps be another survival; a notable <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1037"></a>Page 57</span>instance occurs in <i>Viga-Glums Saga</i>, where the warrior Vigfus bequeaths his luck to his favourite grandson, Glum. In the <i>Waterdale Saga</i> there are two instances in which it is stated that the luck of the dead grandfather will pass to the grandson who receives
his name. Scholars do not, however, agree as to the place of the rebirth idea in the Helgi poems, some holding the view that
it is an essential part of the story.

</p>
<p id="d0e1052">It is possible that the werwolf story is a totem survival. If so, the Hunding feud might easily belong to it: dogs are the
natural enemies of wolves. It is curious that the Irish werwolf Cormac has a feud with MacCon (<i>i.e.</i>, Son of a Dog), which means the same as Hunding. This story, which has not been printed, will be found in the Bodleian MS.

</p>
<p id="d0e1091">Professor Child is perhaps hasty in regarding the two parts of <i>Clerk Saunders</i> as independent. The first part, though unlike the Helgi story in circumstance, seems to preserve the tradition of the hero's
hostility to his bride's kindred, and his death at their hands.

</p>
<p id="d0e1096">The Helgi story, in all its variants, is as familiar in <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1098"></a>Page 58</span>Danish as in Border ballads. The distribution of the material in Iceland, Denmark, England and Scotland is strongly in favour
of the presumption that Scandinavian legend influenced England and Scotland, and against the presumption that the poems in
question passed from the British Isles to Iceland. The evidence of the Danish ballads should be conclusive on this point.
There is an English translation of the latter by R.C.A. Prior (<i>Ancient Danish Ballads</i>, London, 1860).

<p id="d0e1110">The Skald Bragi (before 850 A.D.) has a poem on this subject, given with a translation in the <i>Corpus</i>, vol. ii. Saxo's version is in the fifth book of his History. According to Bragi, Hild has a necklace, which has caused comparison
of this story with that of the Greek Eriphyle. Irish legendary history describes a similar battle in which the slain revive
each night and renew the fight daily, as occurring in the wanderings of the Tuatha De Danann before they reached Ireland.
According to Keating, they learnt the art of necromancy in the East, and taught it to the Danes.

in this case due to the same cause as the custom which prevailed in the dynasty of the Ptolemies, where the king often married
his sister, that his heir might be of the pure royal blood.

and the mortal lover who wins her and whom she afterwards loses, the story would be a parallel to those of Venus and Adonis,
Ishtar and Tammuz, &amp;c., which Frazer derives from the ritual marriage of human sacrifices to the Goddess of fertility. The
reason given in the Edda for Brynhild's sleep, and her connexion with Odin, are secondary, arising from the Valhalla myth.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
